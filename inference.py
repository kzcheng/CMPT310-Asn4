# Question 0 (0 points): DiscreteDistribution Class

# Throughout this project, we will be using the DiscreteDistribution class defined in inference.py to model belief distributions and weight distributions. This class is an extension of the built-in Python dictionary class, where the keys are the different discrete elements of our distribution, and the corresponding values are proportional to the belief or weight that the distribution assigns that element. This question asks you to fill in the missing parts of this class, which will be crucial for later questions (even though this question itself is worth no points).

# First, fill in the normalize method, which normalizes the values in the distribution to sum to one, but keeps the proportions of the values the same. Use the total method to find the sum of the values in the distribution. For an empty distribution or a distribution where all of the values are zero, do nothing. Note that this method modifies the distribution directly, rather than returning a new distribution.

# Second, fill in the sample method, which draws a sample from the distribution, where the probability that a key is sampled is proportional to its corresponding value. Assume that the distribution is not empty, and not all of the values are zero. Note that the distribution does not necessarily have to be normalized prior to calling this method. You may find Python's built-in random.random() function useful for this question.

# There are no autograder tests for this question, but the correctness of your implementation can be easily checked. We have provided Python doctests as a starting point, and you can feel free to add more and implement other tests of your own. You can run the doctests using:
#   python -m doctest -v inference.py

# Note that, depending on the implementation details of the sample method, some correct implementations may not pass the doctests that are provided. To thoroughly check the correctness of your sample method, you should instead draw many samples and see if the frequency of each key converges to be proportional of its corresponding value.

# Question 1 (2 points): Observation Probability

# In this question, you will implement the getObservationProb method in the InferenceModule base class in inference.py . This method takes in an observation (which is a noisy reading of the distance to the ghost), Pacman's position, the ghost's position, and the position of the ghost's jail, and returns the probability of the noisy distance reading given Pacman's position and the ghost's position. In other words, we want to return P(noisyDistance | pacmanPosition, ghostPosition) .

# The distance sensor has a probability distribution over distance readings given the true distance from Pacman to the ghost. This distribution is modeled by the function busters.getObservationProbability(noisyDistance, trueDistance) , which returns P(noisyDistance | trueDistance) and is provided for you. You should use this function to help you solve the problem, and use the provided manhattanDistance function to find the distance between Pacman's location and the ghost's location.

# However, there is the special case of jail that we have to handle as well. Specifically, when we capture a ghost and send it to the jail location, our distance sensor deterministically returns None , and nothing else. So, if the ghost's position is the jail position, then the observation is None with probability 1, and everything else with probability 0. Conversely, if the distance reading is not None , then the ghost is in jail with probability 0. If the distance reading is None, then the ghost is in jail with probability 1. Make sure you handle this special case in your implementation.

# To test your code and run the autograder for this question:
#   python autograder.py -q q1

# As a general note, it is possible for some of the autograder tests to take a long time to run for this project, and you will have to exercise patience. As long as the autograder doesn't time out, you should be fine (provided that you actually pass the tests).

# Question 2 (3 points): Exact Inference Observation

# In this question, you will implement the observeUpdate method in ExactInference class of inference.py to correctly update the agent's belief distribution over ghost positions given an observation from Pacman's sensors. You are implementing the online belief update for observing new evidence. The observe method should, for this problem, update the belief at every position on the map after receiving a sensor reading. You should iterate your updates over the variable self.allPositions which includes all legal positions plus the special jail position. Beliefs represent the probability that the ghost is at a particular location, and are stored as a DiscreteDistribution object in a field called self.beliefs , which you should update.

# Before typing any code, write down the equation of the inference problem you are trying to solve. You should use the function self.getObservationProb that you wrote in the last question, which returns the probability of an observation given Pacman's position, a potential ghost position, and the jail position. You can obtain Pacman's position using gameState.getPacmanPosition() , and the jail position using self.getJailPosition() .

# In the Pacman display, high posterior beliefs are represented by bright colors, while low beliefs are represented by dim colors. You should start with a large cloud of belief that shrinks over time as more evidence accumulates. As you watch the test cases, be sure that you understand how the squares converge to their final coloring.

# Note: your busters agents have a separate inference module for each ghost they are tracking. That's why if you print an observation inside the update function, you'll only see a single number even though there may be multiple ghosts on the board.

# To run the autograder for this question and visualize the output:
#   python autograder.py -q q2

# If you want to run this test (or any of the other tests) without graphics you can add the following flag:
#   python autograder.py -q q2 --no-graphics

# *IMPORTANT*: In general, it is possible sometimes for the autograder to time out if running the tests with graphics. To accurately determine whether or not your code is efficient enough, you should run the tests with the --no-graphics flag. If the autograder passes with this flag, then you will receive full points, even if the autograder times out with graphics.
